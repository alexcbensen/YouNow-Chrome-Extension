# Alex's BetterNow

A Chrome extension that adds visual enhancements and quality-of-life improvements to YouNow.

## Features

### Grid View Mode
Toggle a grid layout for multi-person broadcasts, allowing you to see all participants equally in a 2x2 grid instead of one main video with a smaller guest feed.

### Auto Chest Drop
Automatically open your treasure chest when it reaches a set like threshold while broadcasting. Features a clean UI that matches YouNow's native style.

**Note:** There is currently a bug where this feature only works on non-partnered accounts.
